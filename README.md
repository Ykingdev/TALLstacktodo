## About this project

Hi im shin! I made this project for 2 reasons. 
1. Put my laravel skills to use and learn more about the TALL stack.
2. To show off the fact that I can make a todo app. (before this I actually never made one).

### How to run this project

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `composer install` in the repository 
3. Run `npm install` in the repository
4. Run `npm run dev` in the repository
5. Run `php artisan serve` in the repository ( personally I use herd so if you do too make sure this repository is in the herd directory)
6. Go to `http://whateveryourenamedthefolderto.test` (assuming you are using herd. If not go to `http://localhost:8000`)


Have fun with the project! If you find any bugs or have any suggestions please let me know! Even though im not actively working on this project I will still look at the issues and pull requests.
